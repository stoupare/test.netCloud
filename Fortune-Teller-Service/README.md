# Fortune-Teller-Service - ASP.NET Core Microservice
ASP.NET Core sample app illustrating how to use [Spring Cloud Eureka Server](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/docs/1.0.3/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server) for registering micro services. The Fortune-Teller-Service registers the fortuneService with the Eureka server upon startup.

Note: You can run this either locally or on CloudFoundry.

# Pre-requisites - Running Local

This sample assumes that there is a running Spring Cloud Eureka Server on your machine. To make this happen:

1. Install Java 8 JDK.
2. Install Maven 3.x.
3. Clone the Spring Cloud Samples Eureka repository. (https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/eureka.git)
4. Go to the eureka server directory (`eureka`) and fire it up with `mvn spring-boot:run`
5. When running locally, this sample will default to looking for its eurka server on http://localhost:8761/eureka, so it should all connect.
6. Install .NET Core SDK 

# Building & Running - Local

1. Clone this repo. (i.e. git clone https://github.com/SteeltoeOSS/Samples)
2. cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller-Service
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5000

# What to expect - Local
After building and running the app, you should see something like the following:
```
$ cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller-Service
$ dotnet run --server.urls http://*:5000
info: Microsoft.Data.Entity.Storage.Internal.InMemoryStore[1]
      Saved 50 entities to in-memory store.
Hosting environment: Production
Now listening on: http://*:5000
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```
At this point the Fortune Teller Service is up and running and ready for the [Fortune Teller UI]() to ask for fortunes.

# Pre-requisites - CloudFoundry

1. Installed Pivotal CloudFoundry 1.7+
2. Optionally install DiegoWindows support (Greenhouse)
3. Installed Spring Cloud Services 1.0.9+
4. Install .NET Core SDK
5. Web tools installed and on PATH, (e.g. npm, gulp, etc).  
Note: If you're on Windows and you have VS2015 Update 3, you can add these to your path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Web\External.

# Setup Service Registry on CloudFoundry
You must first create an instance of the Service Registry service in a org/space.

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cf create-service p-service-registry standard myDiscoveryService 
3. Wait for the service to become ready! (i.e. cf services)

# Publish App & Push to CloudFoundry

1. cf target -o myorg -s development
2. cd samples/Discovery/src/AspDotNetCore/Fortune-Teller-Service
3. dotnet restore --configfile nuget.config
4. Publish app to a directory selecting the framework and runtime you want to run on. 
(e.g. `dotnet publish --output $PWD/publish --configuration Release --framework netcoreapp1.1 --runtime ubuntu.14.04-x64`)
5. Push the app using the appropriate manifest.
 (e.g. `cf push -f manifest.yml -p $PWD/publish` or `cf push -f manifest-windows.yml -p $PWD/publish`)

Windows Note: If you are pushing to a windows stack, and you are using self-signed certificates you are likely to run into SSL certificate validation issues when pushing this app. You have two choices to fix this:

1. If you have created your own ROOT CA and from it created a certificate that you have installed in HAProxy/Ext LB, then you can install the ROOT CA on the windows cells and you would be good to go.
2. Disable certificate validation for the Spring Cloud Discovery Client.  You can do this by editing `appsettings.json` and add `eureka:client:validate_certificates=false`.

# What to expect - CloudFoundry
After building and running the app, you should see something like the following in the logs. 

To see the logs as you startup and use the app: `cf logs fortuneservice`

On a Windows cell, you should see something like this during startup:
